# Traffic Data Simulation

This project simulates traffic flow at multiple intersections over a 24-hour period. The traffic data is modeled using Gaussian distributions and factors such as weather conditions, rush hours, and incidents.

## Features
- Simulates traffic flow across intersections.
- Factors in weather, rush hours, and incidents.
- Generates visual plots of traffic flow over time.
- Exports the data to a CSV file.
- Computes and displays basic statistics for each intersection.

## How to Run
To run this project, simply execute `traffic_simulation.py`:

```bash
python traffic_simulation.py
